        ********* Seas of Yore : A Medieval Take on Battleship **********
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Seas of Yore is a turn-based naval strategy game inspired by the quintessential
Battleship, where you're playing in a new, archaic set of circumstances. Instead
of mighty battleships with guns, you do battle with wooden vessels, armed with
catapults. 

With custom hand-drawn sprites, unique, historically themed dialog and art, 
and the addition of the classic Battleship SALVO additional game mode, there's 
a lot of fun to be had. The user experience was designed to be smooth, and the 
controls as minimal and intuitive as possible. 

This was designed by someone who used to play a lot of computer games, so I have 
a decent idea of what is good and what isn't in terms of game development. I am,
however, still learning. I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I did making it.



		    ########### Key Features ###########

Historical theme: Britons vs. Franks, with medieval-inspired prompts and visuals.

Dynamic animations: Includes falling stone effects, ocean wave animations, and thematic 
		    transitions. 

Intuitive interface: Distinct visual feedback for hits/misses, an intuitive sidebar menu 
		     for ship selection, ships you can hold by clicking with your mouse,
		     and instantaneous event-driven ship placement validation.

Ye-Old-Terminal: Keep an eye on the bottom of the screen! It looks like computers are now
		 in the "Ye-Olden-Days", because in Seas of Yore, they can be seen tutoring
		 noble lords on naval warfare! If you're ever unsure of what to do next, take 
		 a look at the Ye-Old-Terminal and lo, it shall guide thee...
